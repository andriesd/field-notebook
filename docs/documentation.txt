============================
ADMIN AND DEVELOPMENT SERVER
============================
The following instructions are for setting up your Admin Page, so you can get started entering data into your Field Notebook.

1. Follow instructions for 'Quick Start' in README.rst for initial installation. 

2. Run `python manage.py createsuperuser' to create super user for admin. Follow command line prompts.

3. Once your superuser account has been created successfully, start the development server. To start the development server, run `python
manage.py runserver`. The default port used after running this command is port 8000. If you would like to use a different port, enter `python manage.py runserver <port>`, e.g., `python manage.py runserver 8080`. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ to start entering data.

For further reference on modifying the admin interface or changing the models and URL configurations, please see tutorials and documentation for Django at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/
